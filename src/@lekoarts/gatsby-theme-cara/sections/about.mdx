Information Systems Student with full focus on the main MERN Stack focused on Back-end servers and the visual part of the application the Front-end,

Since I became interested in this Stack mentioned in the previous paragraph, I have taken back-end courses and NoSQL language, which gave me more conviction to enter this market that today is already the best and most promising of all time ranging from junior systems analyst to higher level positions as a machine learning engineer;
